+ As the owner of this bot, I've customized it to fit my personal preferences and interests. Using the Telegram Bot API and GO programming language, I've equipped my bot with all sorts of fun and useful features.
+  I do not intend to offend or harm anyone. The use of this code remains at your own conscience and under your responsibility. 
Peace for everyone :blue_heart:

 Building and customizing my Telegram bot has been incredibly educational and rewarding. I've improved my knowledge of GO programming language, sharpened my technical skills, and honed my problem-solving abilities.
Basically I used the following technologies and packages:
```
github.com/golang/go
github.com/go-telegram-bot-api/telegram-bot-api
Default packages: "fmt", "encoding/json", "net/http", "io", "time", "math/rand" 
```

If for some reason you decide to use this code :smile: then for your own bot based on this code you need to:
1. Install GO and setup GO environment;
2. Clone this repo to your local machine;
3. Create new bot in [BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather);
4. Get a unique token for your new bot from BotFather;
5. Insert token into */telega/telegabot.go* instead of **TgBotToken** variable in **TelegramBot** function;
6. Launch main.go
7. Voila, enjoy the result.
